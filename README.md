Meekster
========

Meekster implements a Meek Single Transferable Vote (STV) voting system, as described in the [Proportional Representation Foundation's] [1] [Reference Meek Rule] [2], in Ruby.

This software is a work-in-progress. You probably shouldn't use it for an actual election (yet).

Some testing has been done against [Droop] [3], a Python Library that implements STV. Thanks to the authors of Droop for the software and test ballot files.
